A SketchUp extension for framing a building.


Future work:

Save Settings:
 Sketchup.read_default "mysection", "variable", "default"
 Sketchup.write_default "mysection", "variable", "value"


2) skin thickness and perhaps a settable offset value so skin on adjoining wall/floor/ceiling/roof join on edges correctly...
3) skin and rim joists on floor (ability to select rim joints as lumber and joists as engineered for example)
4) openings in floor (create floor/ceiling framing with openings for stairs, AC vents, etc)
5) openings in roof (skylights, hatches)
