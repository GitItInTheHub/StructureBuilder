A SketchUp extension for modeling structures (houses, sheds, post-frame buildings).

This project is an enhancement to the 'HouseBuilder' SketchUp plugin (https://sketchucation.com/forums/viewtopic.php?f=323&t=61712), to allow modeling post-frame buildings along with some bug fixes.

To use (1-time):
-Download the contents of the 'src' folder.
-Zip the downloaded folder/files
-Rename the zipped folder/files file that ends with "zip" to "rbz"
-In SketchUp, choose the extension manager, navigate to the .rbz file you created, and select it.
-In SketchUp's view menu, choose 'Toolbars', and select 'Structure Builder' to tell SketchUp to display the toolbar.

To use (each time):
-From the 'Structure Builder' toolbar, or the 'Structure Builder' menu found under the Draw menu, choose the various functions that allow you to model building structures.
